# EgLib API Reference

Plugin version: 0.4.0

## API Design

Due to the potential confusion between Lua static method calls (using `.`) and instance method calls (using `:`), we have decided to have module functions use instance methods (i.e., called with `:`) as much as possible to prevent user confusion, event if the function is a static method.

## Error Handling

Yes, REFramework will automatically catch script exceptions. However, due to some technical issues, while errors generated by calling `EgLib` will be caught, the error messages will be lost, which is very unfavorable for debugging.

We recommend using `pcall` or other methods to wrap potentially error-prone functions and then print out the error messages.

Example:

```lua{3}
local ok, result = pcall(function()
    -- your code here
    eglib.memory.patch(0x0, {0x90, 0x90}) -- this line will raise an error
end)
if not ok then
    -- handle the error here, or raise it again
    error(tostring(result))
end
```
